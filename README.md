# Blood-smear-analysis-using-YOLO-v5

We've developed a model that is capable of predicting the RBC, WBC & Platelets, draw bounding boxes around them and provide a count of each from a given sample of blood smear. The model has been developed using YOLO-v5. We implemented YOLO versions v5s, v5m, v5l and results obtained have been tabulated in the **Results.xlsx** file.

The **Dataset** folder contains images that had been used to train the model.

You can find the models that we used to train the model, in the **models** folder.

You can run the model against your own images by using the **Blood smear analysis.ipynb** notebook or by using the **Colab notebook** provided below. Inorder to use the colab notebook make sure to make a copy of it and save it your drive, and follow along the instructions given there.

This model was developed as part of a research internship at **Center of Excellence(CoE), RV College of Engineering, Bangalore.**
